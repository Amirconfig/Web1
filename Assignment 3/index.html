        <h2>Mirror, Mirror</h2><br>
        <h3>by Cara Delevingne</h3>
        <p>The novel tells the story of a group of friends from different walks of life 
            who are in a band together. When one of the members goes missing and is later 
            found unconscious and severely injured, the remaining three work together to 
            find the culprit, all while dealing with problems of their own.</p>

            <p>I'm Amir, a computer programming student at Sheridan College Trafalgar Campus.
                One of my interests is programming, computers and technology.  
                Learning about computers has fascinated me since a young age, 
                and that's one of the reasons why I'm looking to learn programming, 
                web design, and networking. But I must mention that my main interest 
                is art and music.  And I know that this question comes to you, why don't 
                I study art?  Well, I don't know either.</p>
                <p>The things that I like to do in my spare time, and they are my hobbies in a way, 
                are walking, playing piano, or listening to music.</p>
                <p>The goal I have for myself is very big and there is a long way to reach it, 
                my goal is to continue my education till PhD and after that working for a while, 
                and then starting my own company and be the head of my own company.</p>
